# Color System

All the colors of our app to support theming and complex UI components.
The color palette for the Little World Design System is defined by four overarching goals:

Comprehensive
The color system supports theming, data visualization, accent colors, and complex user interfaces.

Accessible
The color system provides sufficient contrast ratio and adheres to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines where possible.

Consistent
The color system enables a consistent appearance across varied products and platforms.

Scalable
The color system can be extended with minimal disruption to existing implementations.

The LW Design System utilises color tokens, which allows a designer or developer to understand how or when to apply our palette and the options available. They are used to bridge the gap between naming and use.
Color tokens are semantically named styled labels.
Currently we have two themes, light and dark, so each color token is assigned two color values.

After the the theme value, comes the label that represents the UI element that the color is for. The next is the role of that color or it's emphasis.

## Text

<Unstyled>
  <ColorSection section="text" />
</Unstyled>

## Surface

<Unstyled>
  <ColorSection section="surface" />
</Unstyled>
