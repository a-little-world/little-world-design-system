  Icons are small and contextual, if you need something more prominent, exciting
  and prominent you need an illustration.

  Icons are small graphical elements used to communicate short simple concepts and draw attention to important information. The can be used inside buttons and other inline UI elements.

  In order to be accessible they are always rendered with a label that is hidden.

  Only use icons without additional clarification if you're sure that it can communicate the message at a glance without lots of thinking.
